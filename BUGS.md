Here are the bugs of the 2.0 Beta:
=============================
###1. Command blocks save the data but will not process the command when told to (pushes error)
* Do not use command blocks.
* Do not think that I stole Arjay's code, mine is completely different (It would explain why it's broken :P)

###2. Not many extra crafting/smelting recipes appear.
* This is because BL doesn't support custom crafting recipes with custom blocks.
