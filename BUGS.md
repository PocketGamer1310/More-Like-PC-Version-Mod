Here are the bugs of the 2.0 Beta:
=============================
###1. Command blocks save the data but will not process the command when told to (pushes error)
*Do not use command blocks.
*Do not think that I stole Arjay's code, mine is completely different (It would explain why it's broken :P)
###2. Emerald ore does not drop emeralds when mined.
*It is meant to drop emeralds.
*It ignores the code.
###3. Hunger for one part is Tip Messages and the rest is Client Messages.
*I have not finished temporary hunger display.
###4. The report bugs message does not show.
*I need to delay the time it takes to display.
###5. You cannot prevent hunger from depleting. 
*I need to put the foods in an array and fix it from there.
###6. Not many extra crafting/smelting recipes appear.
*This is because BL doesn't support custom crafting recipes with custom blocks.
