Here are the bugs of the 2.0 Beta:
=============================
###1. Command blocks save the data but will not process the command when told to (pushes error)
* Do not use command blocks.
* Do not think that I stole Arjay's code, mine is completely different (It would explain why it's broken :P)

###2. The report bugs message does not show.
* I need to delay the time it takes to display.

###3. Not many extra crafting/smelting recipes appear.
* This is because BL doesn't support custom crafting recipes with custom blocks.

###4. Redstone torch textures are broken.
* Blame Zhuowei for not finishing render types.
* I will switch to a different render type soon.
